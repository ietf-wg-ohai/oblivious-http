--- abstract

This document describes a system for the forwarding of encrypted HTTP messages.
This allows a client to make multiple requests of a server without the server being able
to link those requests to the client or to identify the requests as having come
from the same client.

# Introduction

The act of making a request using HTTP reveals information about the client
identity to a server. Though the content of requests might reveal information,
that is information under the control of the client. In comparison, the source
address on the connection reveals information that a client has only limited
control over.

Even where an IP address is not directly attributed to an individual, the use
of an address over time can be used to correlate requests. Servers are able to
use this information to assemble profiles of client behavior, from which they
can make inferences about the people involved. The use of persistent
connections to make multiple requests improves performance, but provides
servers with additional certainty about the identity of clients in a similar
fashion.

Use of an HTTP proxy can provide a degree of protection against servers
correlating requests. Systems like virtual private networks or the Tor network
{{Dingledine2004}}, provide other options for clients.

Though the overhead imposed by these methods varies, the cost for each request
is significant. Preventing request linkability requires that each request
use a completely new TLS connection to the server. At a minimum,
this requires an additional round trip to the server in addition to that
required by the request. In addition to having high latency, there are
significant secondary costs, both in terms of the number of additional bytes
exchanged and the CPU cost of cryptographic computations.

This document describes a method of encapsulation for binary HTTP messages
{{BINARY}} using Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE;
{{!HPKE=I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}). This protects the content of both requests and
responses and enables a deployment architecture that can separate the identity
of a requester from the request.

Though this scheme requires that servers and proxies explicitly support it,
this design represents a performance improvement over options that perform just
one request in each connection. With limited trust placed in the proxy (see
{{security}}), clients are assured that requests are not uniquely attributed to
them or linked to other requests.

  encapsulate that response, then return that response.

Oblivious Target Resource:

: The resource that is the target of an encapsulated request.  This resource
  logically handles only regular HTTP requests and responses and so might be
  ignorant of the use of oblivious HTTP to reach it.

This draft includes pseudocode that uses the functions and conventions defined
in {{!HPKE}}.

Encoding an integer to a sequence of bytes in network byte order is described
using the function `encode(n, v)`, where `n` is the number of bytes and `v` is
the integer value. The function `len()` returns the length of a sequence of
bytes.

Formats are described using notation from {{Section 1.3 of QUIC}}.


# Overview

A client learns the following:

* The identity of an oblivious request resource.  This might include some
  information about oblivious target resources that the oblivious request
  resource supports.

* The details of an HPKE public key that the oblivious request resource accepts,
  including an identifier for that key and the HPKE algorithms that are
  used with that key.

* The identity of an oblivious proxy resource that will forward encapsulated
  requests and responses to the oblivious request resource.

This information allows the client to make a request of an oblivious target
resource without that resource having only a limited ability to correlate that
request with the client IP or other requests that the client might make to that
server.

{: #fig-overview title="Overview of Oblivious HTTP"}

In order to make a request to an oblivious target resource, the following steps
occur, as shown in {{fig-overview}}:

1. The client constructs an HTTP request for an oblivious target resource.

2. The client encodes the HTTP request in a binary HTTP message and then
   encapsulates that message using HPKE and the process from {{request}}.

3. The client sends a POST request to the oblivious proxy resource with the
   encapsulated request as the content of that message.

4. The oblivious proxy resource forwards this request to the oblivious request
   resource.

5. The oblivious request resource receives this request and removes
   the HPKE protection to obtain an HTTP request.

6. The oblivious request resource makes an HTTP request that includes the target
   URI, method, fields, and content of the request it acquires.

7. The oblivious target resource answers this HTTP request with an HTTP
   response.

8. The oblivious request resource encapsulates the HTTP response following the
   process in {{response}} and sends this in response to the request from the
   oblivious proxy resource.

9. The oblivious proxy resource forwards this response to the client.

10. The client removes the encapsulation to obtain the response to the original
    request.


## Applicability

Oblivious HTTP has limited applicability.  Many uses of HTTP benefit from being
able to carry state between requests, such as with cookies ({{?RFC6265}}),
authentication ({{Section 11 of HTTP}}), or even alternative services
({{?RFC7838}}).  Oblivious HTTP seeks to prevent this sort of linkage, which
requires that applications not carry state between requests.

Oblivious HTTP is primarily useful where privacy risks associated with possible
stateful treatment of requests are sufficiently negative that the cost of
deploying this protocol can be justified.  Oblivious HTTP is simpler and less
costly than more robust systems, like Prio ({{PRIO}}) or Tor
({{Dingledine2004}}), which can provide stronger guarantees at higher operational costs.

Oblivious HTTP is more costly than a direct connection to a server.  Some costs,
like those involved with connection setup, can be amortized, but there are
several ways in which oblivious HTTP is more expensive than a direct request:

* Each oblivious request requires at least two regular HTTP requests, which adds
  latency.

* Each request is expanded in size with additional HTTP fields,
  encryption-related metadata, and AEAD expansion.

* Deriving cryptographic keys and applying them for request and
  response protection takes non-negligible computational resources.

Examples of where preventing the linking of requests might justify these costs
include:

* DNS queries.  DNS queries made to a recursive resolver reveal information
  about the requester, particularly if linked to other queries.

* Telemetry submission.  Applications that submit reports about their usage to
  their developers might use oblivious HTTP for some types of moderately
  sensitive data.


# Key Configuration {#key-configuration}

A client needs to acquire information about the key configuration of the
oblivious request resource in order to send encapsulated requests.

In order to ensure that clients do not encapsulate messages that other entities
can intercept, the key configuration MUST be authenticated and have integrity
protection.

This document describes the "application/ohttp-keys" media type; see
{{ohttp-keys}}.  This media type might be used, for example with HTTPS, as part
of a system for configuring or discovering key configurations.  Note however
that such a system needs to consider the potential for key configuration to be
used to compromise client privacy; see {{privacy}}.

Specifying a format for expressing the information a client needs to construct
an encapsulated request ensures that different client implementations can be
configured in the same way. This also enables advertising key configurations in
a consistent format.

A client might have multiple key configurations to select from when
encapsulating a request. Clients are responsible for selecting a preferred key
configuration from those it supports. Clients need to consider both the key
encapsulation method (KEM) and the combinations of key derivation function
(KDF) and authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) in this
decision.

Evolution of the key configuration format is supported through the definition
of new formats that are identified by new media types.


## Key Configuration Encoding {#key-config}

A single key configuration consists of a key identifier, a public key, an
identifier for the KEM that the public key uses, and a set HPKE symmetric
algorithms. Each symmetric algorithm consists of an identifier for a KDF and an
identifier for an AEAD.

{{format-key-config}} shows a single key configuration, KeyConfig, that is
expressed using the TLS syntax; see {{Section 3 of TLS}}.

~~~ tls-syntax
opaque HpkePublicKey[Npk];
uint16 HpkeKemId;
uint16 HpkeKdfId;
uint16 HpkeAeadId;

struct {
  HpkeKdfId kdf_id;
  HpkeAeadId aead_id;
} HpkeSymmetricAlgorithms;

struct {
  uint8 key_id;
  HpkeKemId kem_id;
  HpkePublicKey public_key;
  HpkeSymmetricAlgorithms cipher_suites<4..2^16-4>;
} KeyConfig;
~~~
{: #format-key-config title="A Single Key Configuration"}

The types HpkeKemId, HpkeKdfId, and HpkeAeadId identify a KEM, KDF, and AEAD
respectively. The definitions for these identifiers and the semantics of the
algorithms they identify can be found in {{!HPKE}}. The Npk parameter
corresponding to the HpkeKdfId can be found in {{!HPKE}}.


## Key Configuration Media Type {#ohttp-keys}

The "application/ohttp-keys" format is a media type that identifies a
serialized collection of key configurations. The content of this media type
comprises one or more key configuration encodings (see {{key-config}}) that are
concatenated.

# HPKE Encapsulation

HTTP message encapsulation uses HPKE for request and response encryption.

An encapsulated HTTP request includes a timestamp and a binary-encoded HTTP
message {{BINARY}}; see {{fig-req-pt}}.

~~~
Request {
  Timestamp (32),
  Binary HTTP Message (..),
}
~~~
{: #fig-req-pt title="Plaintext Request Content"}

The Timestamp field contains the least significant 32 bits of the time in
seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z {{?RFC3339}}.

An Encapsulated Request is comprised of a length-prefixed key identifier and a
HPKE-protected request message. HPKE protection includes an encapsulated KEM
shared secret (or `enc`), plus the AEAD-protected request message. An
Encapsulated Request is shown in {{fig-enc-request}}. {{request}} describes the
process for constructing and processing an Encapsulated Request.

~~~
Encapsulated Request {
  Key Identifier (8),
  KEM Identifier (16),
  KDF Identifier (16),
  AEAD Identifier (16),
  Encapsulated KEM Shared Secret (8*Nenc),
  AEAD-Protected Request (..),
}
~~~
{: #fig-enc-request title="Encapsulated Request"}

The Nenc parameter corresponding to the HpkeKdfId can be found in {{!HPKE}}.

An encapsulated HTTP response includes a binary-encoded HTTP message {{BINARY}}
and no other content; see {{fig-res-pt}}.

~~~
Response {
  Binary HTTP Message (..),
}
~~~
{: #fig-res-pt title="Plaintext Response Content"}

Responses are bound to responses and so consist only of AEAD-protected content.
{{response}} describes the process for constructing and processing an
Encapsulated Response.

~~~
Encapsulated Response {
  Nonce (Nk),
  AEAD-Protected Response (..),
}
~~~
{: #fig-enc-response title="Encapsulated Response"}

The size of the Nonce field in an Encapsulated Response corresponds to the
size of an AEAD key for the corresponding HPKE ciphersuite.


## Encapsulation of Requests {#request}

Clients encapsulate a request `request` using values from a key configuration:

* the key identifier from the configuration, `keyID`, with the corresponding KEM
  identified by `kemID`,

* the public key from the configuration, `pkR`, and

* a selected combination of KDF, identified by `kdfID`, and AEAD, identified by
  `aeadID`.

The client then constructs an encapsulated request, `enc_request`, as follows:

1. Compute an HPKE context using `pkR`, yielding `context` and encapsulation
   key `enc`.

2. Construct plaintext as the current time in seconds since Jan 1, 1970, modulo
   2<sup>32</sup> concatenated with the binary encoded HTTP message.

3. Construct associated data, `aad`, by concatenating the values of `keyID`,
   `kemID`, `kdfID`, and `aeadID`, as one 8-bit integer and three 16-bit
   integers, respectively, each in network byte order.

4. Encrypt (seal) `request` with `aad` as associated data using `context`,
   yielding ciphertext `ct`.

5. Concatenate the values of `aad`, `enc`, and `ct`, yielding an Encapsulated
   Request `enc_request`.

Note that `enc` is of fixed-length, so there is no ambiguity in parsing this
structure.

In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

~~~
enc, context = SetupBaseS(pkR, "request")
pt = encode(4, timestamp) || request
aad = concat(encode(1, keyID),
             encode(2, kemID),
             encode(2, kdfID),
             encode(2, aeadID))
ct = context.Seal(aad, pt)
enc_request = concat(aad, enc, ct)
~~~

Servers decrypt an Encapsulated Request by reversing this process. Given an
Encapsulated Request `enc_request`, a server:

1. Parses `enc_request` into `keyID`, `kemID`, `kdfID`, `aeadID`, `enc`, and `ct`
   (indicated using the function `parse()` in pseudocode). The server is then
   able to find the HPKE private key, `skR`, corresponding to `keyID`.

   a. If `keyID` does not identify a key matching the type of `kemID`, the server
      returns an error.

   b. If `kdfID` and `aeadID` identify a combination of KDF and AEAD that the
      server is unwilling to use with `skR`, the server returns an error.

2. Compute an HPKE context using `skR` and the encapsulated key `enc`,
   yielding `context`.

3. Construct additional associated data, `aad`, from `keyID`, `kemID`, `kdfID`,
   and `aeadID` or as the first seven bytes of `enc_request`.

4. Decrypt `ct` using `aad` as associated data, yielding `pt` or an error
   on failure. If decryption fails, the server returns an error.

5. Decode the first 4 bytes of `pt` as a timestamp and the remainder as a binary
   HTTP message.

In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

~~~
keyID, kemID, kdfID, aeadID, enc, ct = parse(enc_request)
aad = concat(encode(1, keyID),
             encode(2, kemID),
             encode(2, kdfID),
             encode(2, aeadID))
context = SetupBaseR(enc, skR, "request")
pt, error = context.Open(aad, ct)
time, request = decode(4, pt[..4]), pt[4..]
~~~


## Encapsulation of Responses {#response}

Given an HPKE context `context`, a request message `request`, and a response
`response`, servers generate an Encapsulated Response `enc_response` as
follows:

1. Export a secret `secret` from `context`, using the string "response" as context.
   The length of this secret is `max(Nn, Nk)`, where `Nn` and `Nk` are the length
   of AEAD key and nonce associated with `context`.

2. Generate a random value of length `max(Nn, Nk)` bytes, called `response_nonce`.

3. Extract a pseudorandom key `prk` using the `Extract` function provided by
   the KDF algorithm associated with `context`. The `ikm` input to this
   function is `secret`; the `salt` input is the concatenation of `enc` (from
   `enc_request`) and `response_nonce`

4. Use the `Expand` function provided by the same KDF to extract an AEAD key
   `key`, of length `Nk` - the length of the keys used by the AEAD associated
   with `context`. Generating `key` uses a label of "key".

5. Use the same `Expand` function to extract a nonce `nonce` of length `Nn` -
   the length of the nonce used by the AEAD. Generating `nonce` uses a label of
   "nonce".

6. Encrypt `response`, passing the AEAD function Seal the values of `key`,
   `nonce`, empty `aad`, and a `pt` input of `request`, which yields `ct`.

7. Concatenate `response_nonce` and `ct`, yielding an Encapsulated Response
   `enc_response`. Note that `response_nonce` is of fixed-length, so there is no
   ambiguity in parsing either `response_nonce` or `ct`.

In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

~~~
secret = context.Export("response", Nk)
response_nonce = random(max(Nn, Nk))
salt = concat(enc, response_nonce)
prk = Extract(salt, secret)
aead_key = Expand(prk, "key", Nk)
aead_nonce = Expand(prk, "nonce", Nn)
ct = Seal(aead_key, aead_nonce, "", response)
enc_response = concat(response_nonce, ct)
~~~

Clients decrypt an Encapsulated Request by reversing this process. That is,
they first parse `enc_response` into `response_nonce` and `ct`. They then
follow the same process to derive values for `aead_key` and `aead_nonce`.

The client uses these values to decrypt `ct` using the Open function provided by
the AEAD. Decrypting might produce an error, as follows:

~~~
reponse, error = Open(aead_key, aead_nonce, "", ct)
~~~


# HTTP Usage {#http-usage}

A client interacts with the oblivious proxy resource by constructing an
encapsulated request.  This encapsulated request is included as the content of a
POST request to the oblivious proxy resource.  This request MUST only contain
those fields necessary to carry the encapsulated request: a method of POST, a
target URI of the oblivious proxy resource, a header field containing
the content type (see ({{media-types}}), and the encapsulated request as the
request content.  Clients MAY include fields that do not reveal information
about the content of the request, such as Alt-Used {{?ALT-SVC=RFC7838}}, or
information that it trusts the oblivious proxy resource to remove, such as
fields that are listed in the Connection header field.

The oblivious proxy resource interacts with the oblivious request resource by
constructing a request using the same restrictions as the client request, except
that the target URI is the oblivious request resource.  The content of this
request is copied from the client.  The oblivious proxy resource MUST NOT add
information about the client to this request.

When a response is received from the oblivious request resource, the oblivious
proxy resource forwards the response according to the rules of an HTTP proxy;
see {{Section 7.6 of HTTP}}.

An oblivious request resource, if it receives any response from the oblivious
target resource, sends a single 200 response containing the encapsulated
response.  Like the request from the client, this response MUST only contain
those fields necessary to carry the encapsulated response: a 200 status code, a
header field indicating the content type, and the encapsulated response as the
response content.  As with requests, additional fields MAY be used to convey
information that does not reveal information about the encapsulated response.

An oblivious request resource acts as a gateway for requests to the oblivious
target resource (see {{Section 7.6 of HTTP}}).  The one exception is that any
information it might forward in a response MUST be encapsulated, unless it is
responding to errors it detects before removing encapsulation of the request;
see {{errors}}.


## Informational Responses

This encapsulation does not permit progressive processing of responses.  Though
the binary HTTP response format does support the inclusion of informational
(1xx) status codes, the AEAD encapsulation cannot be removed until the entire
message is received.

In particular, the Expect header field with 100-continue (see Section 10.1.1 of
{{HTTP}}) cannot be used.  Clients MUST NOT
construct a request that includes a 100-continue expectation; the oblivious
request resource MUST generate an error if a 100-continue expectation is
received.


## Errors

A server that receives an invalid message for any reason MUST generate an HTTP
response with a 4xx status code.

Errors detected by the oblivious proxy resource and errors detected by the
oblivious request resource before removing protection (including being unable to
remove encapsulation for any reason) result in the status code being sent
without protection in response to the POST request made to that resource.

Errors detected by the oblivious request resource after successfully removing
encapsulation and errors detected by the oblivious target resource MUST be sent
in an encapsulated response.


# Media Types {#media-types}

Media types are used to identify encapsulated requests and responses.

Evolution of the format of encapsulated requests and responses is supported
through the definition of new formats that are identified by new media types.

# Security Considerations {#security}

In this design, a client wishes to make a request of a server that is
authoritative for the oblivious target resource. The client wishes to make this
request without linking that request with either:

1. The identity at the network and transport layer of the client (that is, the
   client IP address and TCP or UDP port number the client uses to create a
   connection).

2. Any other request the client might have made in the past or might make in
   the future.

In order to ensure this, the client selects a proxy (that serves the oblivious
proxy resource) that it trusts will protect this information by forwarding the
encapsulated request and response without passing the server (that serves the
oblivious request resource).

In this section, a deployment where there are three entities is considered:

* A client makes requests and receives responses
* A proxy operates the oblivious proxy resource
* A server operates both the oblivious request resource and the oblivious
  target resource

To achieve the stated privacy goals, the oblivious proxy resource cannot be
operated by the same entity as the oblivious request resource. However,
colocation of the oblivious request resource and oblivious target resource
simplifies the interactions between those resources without affecting client
privacy.

As a consequence of this configuration, Oblivious HTTP prevents linkability
described above. Informally, this means:

1. Requests and responses are known only to clients and targets in possession
   of the corresponding response encapsulation key and HPKE keying material.
   In particular, the oblivious proxy knows the origin and destination of an
   encapsulated request and response, yet does not know the decapsulated
   contents. Likewise, targets know only the oblivious request origin, i.e.,
   the proxy, and the decapsulated request. Only the client knows both the
   plaintext request and response.
1. Targets cannot link requests from the same client in the absence of unique
   per-client keys.

Traffic analysis that might affect these properties are outside the scope of this
document; see {{ta}}.

A formal analysis of Oblivious HTTP is in {{OHTTP-ANALYSIS}}.

## Client Responsibilities

Clients MUST ensure that the key configuration they select for generating
encapsulated requests is integrity protected and authenticated so that it can
be attributed to the oblivious request resource; see {{key-configuration}}.

Since clients connect directly to the proxy instead of the target, application
configurations wherein clients make policy decisions about target connections,
e.g., to apply certificate pinning, are incompatible with Oblivious HTTP.  In
such cases, alternative technologies such as HTTP CONNECT
({{Section 9.3.6 of HTTP}}) can be used. Applications could implement related
policies on key configurations and proxy connections, though these might not
provide the same properties as policies enforced directly on target
connections. When this difference is relevant, applications can instead connect
directly to the target at the cost of either privacy or performance.

Clients MUST NOT include identifying information in the request that is
encapsulated. Identifying information includes cookies {{?COOKIES=RFC6265}},
authentication credentials or tokens, and any information that might reveal
client-specific information such as account credentials.

Clients cannot carry connection-level state between requests as they only
establish direct connections to the proxy responsible for the oblivious proxy
resource. However, clients need to ensure that they construct requests without
any information gained from previous requests. Otherwise, the server might be
able to use that information to link requests. Cookies {{?COOKIES=RFC6265}} are
the most obvious feature that MUST NOT be used by clients. However, clients
need to include all information learned from requests, which could include the
identity of resources.

Clients MUST generate a new HPKE context for every request, using a good source
of entropy ({{?RANDOM=RFC4086}}) for generating keys. Key reuse not only risks
requests being linked, reuse could expose request and response contents to the
proxy.

The request the client sends to the oblivious proxy resource only requires
minimal information; see {{http-usage}}. The request that carries the
encapsulated request and is sent to the oblivious proxy resource MUST NOT
include identifying information unless the client ensures that this information
is removed by the proxy. A client MAY include information only for the
oblivious proxy resource in header fields identified by the Connection header
field if it trusts the proxy to remove these as required by Section 7.6.1 of
{{HTTP}}. The client needs to trust that the proxy does not replicate the
source addressing information in the request it forwards.

Clients rely on the oblivious proxy resource to forward encapsulated requests
and responses. However, the proxy can only refuse to forward messages, it
cannot inspect or modify the contents of encapsulated requests or responses.


## Proxy Responsibilities

The proxy that serves the oblivious proxy resource has a very simple function
to perform. For each request it receives, it makes a request of the oblivious
request resource that includes the same content. When it receives a response,
it sends a response to the client that includes the content of the response
from the oblivious request resource. When generating a request, the proxy MUST
follow the forwarding rules in {{Section 7.6 of HTTP}}.

A proxy can also generate responses, though it assumed to not be able to
examine the content of a request (other than to observe the choice of key
identifier, KDF, and AEAD), so it is also assumed that it cannot generate an
encapsulated response.

A proxy MUST NOT add information about the client identity when forwarding
requests. This includes the Via field, the Forwarded field
{{?FORWARDED=RFC7239}}, and any similar information.  A client does not depend
on the proxy using an authenticated and encrypted connection to the oblivious request
resource, only that information about the client not be attached to forwarded
requests.


### Denial of Service {#dos}

As there are privacy benefits from having a large rate of requests forwarded by
the same proxy (see {{ta}}), servers that operate the oblivious request
resource might need an arrangement with proxies. This arrangement might be
necessary to prevent having the large volume of requests being classified as an
attack by the server.

If a server accepts a larger volume of requests from a proxy, it needs to
trust that the proxy does not allow abusive levels of request volumes from
clients. That is, if a server allows requests from the proxy to be exempt from
rate limits, the server might want to ensure that the proxy applies a rate
limiting policy that is acceptable to the server.

Servers that enter into an agreement with a proxy that enables a higher request
rate might choose to authenticate the proxy to enable the higher rate.


### Linkability Through Traffic Analysis {#ta}

As the time at which encapsulated request or response messages are sent can
reveal information to a network observer. Though messages exchanged between the
oblivious proxy resource and the oblivious request resource might be sent in a
single connection, traffic analysis could be used to match messages that are
forwarded by the proxy.

A proxy could, as part of its function, add delays in order to increase the
anonymity set into which each message is attributed. This could latency to the
overall time clients take to receive a response, which might not be what some
clients want.

A proxy can use padding to reduce the effectiveness of traffic analysis.
Padding is a capability provided by binary HTTP messages; see {{Section 3.8 of
BINARY}}.

A proxy that forwards large volumes of exchanges can provide better privacy by
providing larger sets of messages that need to be matched.


## Server Responsibilities

A server that operates both oblivious request and oblivious target resources is
responsible for removing request encapsulation, generating a response the
encapsulated request, and encapsulating the response.

Servers should account for traffic analysis based on response size or generation time.
Techniques such as padding or timing delays can help protect against such attacks;
see {{ta}}.

If separate entities provide the oblivious request resource and oblivious
target resource, these entities might need an arrangement similar to that
between server and proxy for managing denial of service; see {{dos}}. It is
also necessary to provide confidentiality protection for the unprotected
requests and responses, plus protections for traffic analysis; see {{ta}}.

An oblivious request resource needs to have a plan for replacing keys. This
might include regular replacement of keys, which can be assigned new key
identifiers. If an oblivious request resource receives a request that contains
a key identifier that it does not understand or that corresponds to a key that
has been replaced, the server can respond with an HTTP 422 (Unprocessable
Content) status code.

A server can also use a 422 status code if the server has a key that
corresponds to the key identifier, but the encapsulated request cannot be
successfully decrypted using the key.

A server is responsible for either rejecting replayed request or ensuring that
the effect of replays does not adversely affect clients or resources; see
{{replay}}.


## Replay Attacks {#replay}

Encapsulated requests can be copied and replayed by the oblivious proxy
resource. The design of oblivious HTTP does not assume that the oblivious proxy
resource will not replay requests. In addition, if a client sends an
encapsulated request in TLS early data (see {{Section 8 of TLS}} and
{{!RFC8470}}), a network-based adversary might be able to cause the request to
be replayed. In both cases, the effect of a replay attack and the mitigations
that might be employed are similar to TLS early data.

A client or oblivious proxy resource MUST NOT automatically attempt to retry a
failed request unless it receives a positive signal indicating that the request
was not processed or forwarded. The HTTP/2 REFUSED_STREAM error code (Section
8.1.4 of {{!RFC7540}}), the HTTP/3 H3_REQUEST_REJECTED error code (Section 8.1
of {{!QUIC-HTTP=I-D.ietf-quic-http}}), or a GOAWAY frame with a low enough
identifier (in either protocol version) are all sufficient signals that no
processing occurred. Connection failures or interruptions are not sufficient
signals that no processing occurred.

The anti-replay mechanisms described in {{Section 8 of TLS}} are generally
applicable to oblivious HTTP requests. The encapsulated keying material (or
`enc`) can be used in place of a nonce to uniquely identify a request.  This
value is a high-entropy value that is freshly generated for every request, so 
two valid requests will have different values with overwhelming probability.

The mechanism used in TLS for managing differences in client and server clocks
cannot be used as it depends on being able to observe previous interactions.
Oblivious HTTP explicitly prevents such linkability.

The considerations in {{!RFC8470}} as they relate to managing the risk of
replay also apply, though there is no option to delay the processing of a
request.

Limiting requests to those with safe methods might not be satisfactory for some
applications, particularly those that involve the submission of data to a
server. The use of idempotent methods might be of some use in managing replay
risk, though it is important to recognize that different idempotent requests
can be combined to be not idempotent.

Even without strong replay prevention, the server-chosen `response_nonce` field
ensures that responses have unique AEAD keys and nonces even when requests are
replayed.


### Use of Timestamps for Anti-Replay

Request messages include a timestamp from the client.  This value allows a
server to limit the amount of requests it needs to track when preventing
replays.

A server can maintain state for requests for a small window of time over which
it wishes to accept requests.  The server then rejects requests if the request
is the same as one that was previously answered within that time window, which
might use the `enc` value.  The server also rejects requests if the timestamp is
outside of the chosen time window.  For real-time operation, servers should
allow for the time it takes requests to arrive from the client, with a time
window that is large enough to allow for differences between client and server clocks.

How large a time window is needed could depend on the population of clients that
the server needs to serve.  Unlike anti-replay protections in TLS (see {{Section
8 of TLS}}), which correct for differences in the absolute value of client and
server clocks, no system is provided to automatically account for differences in
the absolute value of client and server clocks.  This means that servers might
might need to accept and track requests over larger time windows than would be
used for TLS. Indeed, in practice, client clock skew can be as large as a day {{?CLOCKSKEW=DOI.10.1145/3133956.3134007}} for a non-negligible amount of clients.

Servers MUST NOT treat the time window as secret information. An attacker can actively
probe the server with specially crafted request timestamps to determine the time window
over which the server will accept responses. 

The 32-bit timestamp in seconds could represent multiple times that are
approximately 136 years apart.  If a server accepts requests with the same key
for longer than this time, it exposes itself to replay attacks.  Use of this
specification over that time period is unlikely, but to avoid this problem
servers that depend on the timestamp for anti-replay MUST NOT use the same key
for more than 2<sup>32</sup> seconds.

Clock information provides a small amount of information about the clock at the
client that could be used to link activity from the same client.  Clients MAY
randomize the value that they provide the server to obscure the true value of
their clock and prevent linking of requests over time.  However, this increases
the risk that a server will reject a request due to it being outside of the time
window over which it is tracking request.


## Post-Compromise Security

This design does not provide post-compromise security for responses.

A client only needs to retain keying material that might be used compromise the
confidentiality and integrity of a response until that response is consumed, so
there is negligible risk associated with a client compromise.

A server retains a secret key that might be used to remove protection from messages
over much longer periods. A server compromise that provided access to the
oblivious request resource secret key could allow an attacker to recover the
plaintext of all requests sent toward affected keys and all of the responses
that were generated.

Even if server keys are compromised, an adversary cannot access messages
exchanged by the client with the oblivious proxy resource as messages are
protected by TLS.  Use of a compromised key also requires that the oblivious
proxy resource cooperate with the attacker or that the attacker is able to
compromise these TLS connections.

The total number of affected messages affected by server key compromise can be
limited by regular rotation of server keys.


# Privacy Considerations {#privacy}

One goal of this design is that independent client requests are only linkable
by the chosen key configuration. The oblivious proxy and request resources can link
requests using the same key configuration by matching KeyConfig.key\_id, or, if
the oblivious target resource is willing to use trial decryption, a limited set
of key configurations that share an identifier. An oblivious proxy can link
requests using the public key corresponding to KeyConfig.key\_id.

Request resources are capable of linking requests depending on how KeyConfigs
are produced by servers and discovered by clients. Specifically, servers can
maliciously construct key configurations to track individual clients. A specific
method for a client to acquire key configurations is not included in this
specification. Clients need to consider these tracking vectors when choosing a
discovery method.  Applications using this design should provide accommodations
to mitigate tracking using key configurations.


# Operational and Deployment Considerations {#deployment}

Using Oblivious HTTP adds both cryptographic and latency to requests relative to
a simple HTTP request-response exchange.  Deploying proxy services that are on
path between clients and servers avoids adding significant additional delay due
to network topology.  A study of a similar system {{ODoH}} found that deploying
proxies close to servers was most effective in minimizing additional latency.

Oblivious HTTP might be incompatible with network interception regimes, such as
those that rely on configuring clients with trust anchors and intercepting TLS
connections.  While TLS might be intercepted successfully, interception
middleboxes devices might not receive updates that would allow Oblivious HTTP to
be correctly identified using the media types defined in {{media-types}}.

Oblivious HTTP has a simple key management design that is not trivially altered
to enable interception by intermediaries.  Clients that are configured to enable
interception might choose to disable Oblivious HTTP in order to ensure that
content is accessible to middleboxes.

# Complete Example of a Request and Response

<!-- Generated using ohttp:
RUST_LOG=ohttp cargo test -p ohttp -\-lib -\- -\-nocapture request_response
-->

A single request and response exchange is shown here. Binary values (key
configuration, secret keys, the content of messages, and intermediate values)
are shown in hexadecimal. The request and response here are absolutely minimal;
the purpose of this example is to show the cryptographic operations.

The oblivious request resource generates a key pair. In this example the server
chooses DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256) and generates an X25519 key pair
{{?X25519=RFC7748}}. The X25519 secret key is:

~~~ hex-dump
cb14d538a70d8a74d47fb7e3ac5052a086da127c678d3585dcad72f98e3bff83
~~~

The oblivious request resource constructs a key configuration that includes the
corresponding public key as follows:

~~~ hex-dump
01002012a45279412ea6ef11e9f839bb5a422fc1262b5c023d787e4e636e70ae
d3d56e00080001000100010003
~~~

This key configuration is somehow obtained by the client. Then when a client
wishes to send an HTTP request of a GET request to `https://example.com`, it
constructs the following binary HTTP message:

~~~ hex-dump
00034745540568747470730b6578616d706c652e636f6d012f
~~~

The client then reads the oblivious request resource key configuration and
selects a mutually supported KDF and AEAD. In this example, the client selects
HKDF-SHA256 and AES-128-GCM. The client then generates an HPKE context that
uses the server public key. This results in the following encapsulated key:

~~~ hex-dump
cd7786fd75143f12e03398dbe2bcfa8e01a8132e7b66050674db72730623ca3b
~~~

The corresponding private key is:

~~~ hex-dump
c20afd33a2f2663faf023acf5d56fc08fddd38aada29b21b3b96e16f4326ccf7
~~~

Applying the Seal operation from the HPKE context produces an encrypted
message, allowing the client to construct the following encapsulated request:

~~~ hex-dump
01002000010001cd7786fd75143f12e03398dbe2bcfa8e01a8132e7b66050674
db72730623ca3b68b9e75a0576745da12c4fa5053b7ec06d7f625197564a6087
ec299f8d6fffa2a8addfc1c0f64b4b05
~~~

The client then sends this to the oblivious proxy resource in a POST request,
which might look like the following HTTP/1.1 request:

~~~ http-message
POST /request.example.net/proxy HTTP/1.1
Host: proxy.example.org
Content-Type: message/ohttp-req
Content-Length: 78

<content is the encapsulated request above>
~~~

The oblivious proxy resource receives this request and forwards it to the
oblivious request resource, which might look like:

~~~ http-message
POST /oblivious/request HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: message/ohttp-req
Content-Length: 78

<content is the encapsulated request above>
~~~

The oblivous request resource receives this request, selects the key it
generated previously using the key identifier from the message, and decrypts
the message. As this request is directed to the same server, the oblivious
request resource does not need to initiate an HTTP request to the oblivious
target resource. The request can be served directly by the oblivious target
resource, which generates a minimal response (consisting of just a 200 status
code) as follows:

~~~ hex-dump
0140c8
~~~

The response is constructed by extracting a secret from the HPKE context:

~~~ hex-dump
9c0b96b577b9fc7a5beef536e0ff3a64
~~~

The key derivation for the encapsulated response uses both the encapsulated KEM
key from the request and a randomly selected nonce. This produces a salt of:

~~~ hex-dump
cd7786fd75143f12e03398dbe2bcfa8e01a8132e7b66050674db72730623ca3b
061d62d5df5832c6c9fa4617ceb848a7
~~~

The salt and secret are both passed to the Extract function of the selected KDF
(HKDF-SHA256) to produce a pseudorandom key of:

~~~ hex-dump
a0ab55d3b1811694943bb72c386f59bd030e1278692a3db2f30d8aac2f89a5fc
~~~

The pseudorandom key is used with the Expand function of the KDF and an info
field of "key" to produce a 16-byte key for the selected AEAD (AES-128-GCM):

~~~ hex-dump
1dae9d7fe263d23e51a768bcaf310aa5
~~~

With the same KDF and pseudorandom key, an info field of "nonce" is used to
generate a 12-byte nonce:

~~~ hex-dump
e520beec147740e4f8a3b553
~~~

The AEAD Seal function is then used to encrypt the response, which is added
to the randomized nonce value to produce the encapsulated response:

~~~ hex-dump
061d62d5df5832c6c9fa4617ceb848a7a6f694da45accc3c32ad576cb204f7cd
3bf23e
~~~

The oblivious request resource then constructs a response:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 27 Jan 2021 04:45:07 GMT
Cache-Control: private, no-store
Content-Type: message/ohttp-res
Content-Length: 38

<content is the encapsulated response>
~~~

The same response might then be generated by the oblivious proxy resource which
might change as little as the Date header. The client is then able to use the
HPKE context it created and the nonce from the encapsulated response to
construct the AEAD key and nonce and decrypt the response.
